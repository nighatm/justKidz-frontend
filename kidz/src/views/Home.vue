                PM: Welcome back on this wonderful Monday arctic classroom! We
                worked on our listening and following directions skills by by
                singing and dancing to theFollow Me song! We said our names,
                chose a friend to say hello to and asked them how are you? We
                explored expressing our different feelings to each other! We
                also sang our calendar songs and talked about the cloudy
                weather! During centre time we worked on our colour recognition
                and fine motor skills by sorting different coloured animals into
                their corresponding buckets using clothespins to grab! We also
                worked on our following directions skills as well as hand
                strength and fine motor skills by glueing strips together to
                make the land sky and sea !
